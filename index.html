                            makes everything click.</p>
                        <p>My journey in tech began on the bustling streets of Mumbai, where I first started coding to
                            solve everyday problems. Fast forward to Google, working on search
                            algorithms that touch billions of lives. It’s surreal to think that something I worked on
                            helps someone find what they need faster, all over the world.</p>
                        <p>But what drives me isn’t just the scale or the technology—it’s the impact. When a project
                            like revamping Google Books' partner selection saves $800K annually, that’s real change.
                            It’s about creating solutions that don’t just work—they matter.</p>
                        <p>Outside of Google, I channel this passion into the startup ecosystem, helping fledgling
                            companies build tech that’s not only innovative but scalable. It's a thrill to see a startup
                            grow and know you played a part in that success.</p>
                        <p>My time at Carnegie Mellon was a game-changer. It was intense, sure, but it equipped me with
                            the skills to tackle any challenge thrown my way. Whether it's optimizing a search engine or
                            mentoring a team, I’m all in.</p>

                            <p>"I have known Saheb for two years while working at GST Edge as an intern and then as a
                                Team Lead. In a relatively short period of time, he has managed to become one of the
                                most capable leaders. He has grown to be a very industrious member of the team, who
                                constantly strives on improving the process. His performance has consistently exceeded
                                expectations. There remains no doubt about his dedication, hard work and innovative
                                ideas as he has been stated as a ‘thinking leader’ by one of his most challenging
                                clients. Saheb is constantly faced with situations that are unique for the position that
                                he handles. The admirable part remains that he has never had an escalation against his
                                name and delivers par expectations. While launching one of the projects, the marketing
                                team demanded a new set of UX to be implemented across project. Understanding the need
                                of the hour, he put extra efforts. Apart from his designated profile, he is actively
                                involved in people engagement and collaboration."</p>
